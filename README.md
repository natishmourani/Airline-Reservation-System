# Airline Reservation System  

## Overview  
This project is a **console-based Airline Reservation System** built in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It allows users to:  
- Add and manage **customer details**  
- Register **flights**  
- Generate and print **tickets** (saved to `.txt` files)  
- Display invoices  

The system ensures that flights cannot be booked, and tickets cannot be generated, without entering customer details first.
